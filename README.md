World saves! Hurray!

#### SKY

Our server spawn map! Last loaded using the Fabric version of Sky!

#### TREE GRID

Creative map for structure trees designed for vanilla and Sap blocks! Intended to be used for data in TerraForged, but don't let that stop you!

### DATA

Data to enhance your computing experience!

#### TERRAFORGED

Please note, this has not been worked on since January of 2021. The latest release of version is the last completed work in a complete start over of the project. This was last done in TerraForged 0.2.9, and so it may not be compatible with newer versions. It is far from complete.

An intended datapack for *[TerraForged](https://github.com/TerraForged/TerraForged)* using our *[Sap](https://github.com/yurisuika/Sap)* mod!

To use currently you must replace the data in the mod JAR with the data from this pack.

##### 1.16 - [*`0.2.9`*](https://github.com/yurisuika/SuikaCraft/tree/master/TerraForged%200.2.9)

For Sap 0.3.2 and TerraForged 0.2.9!

##### 1.15 - [*`0.1.3`*](https://github.com/yurisuika/SuikaCraft/tree/master/TerraForged%200.1.3)

For Sap 0.2.4 and TerraForged 0.1.3!
